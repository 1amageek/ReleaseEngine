# ReleaseEngine Interface Contract

## Common shape

```swift
public protocol DomainExecuting: Sendable {
    func execute(
        _ request: DomainRequest
    ) async throws -> XcircuiteEngineResultEnvelope<DomainPayload>
}
```

Requests carry a schema version, run ID and typed artifact references. Payloads contain domain metrics only. Diagnostics and artifacts belong to the shared envelope.

## Products

### ReleaseCore

Signoff and tapeout references.

### SignoffEngine

Required-axis applicability and verdict.

### TapeoutEngine

Stream-out validation and foundry handoff.

### ReleaseEngine

Umbrella API.


## Error contract

- Throw only when execution cannot produce a valid result envelope.
- Represent design findings and failed checks as typed diagnostics and a completed domain payload.
- Represent missing prerequisites or insufficient semantics as `blocked`.
- Preserve cancellation as `cancelled`.
- Do not swallow parser, process or persistence failures.

## Xcircuite adapter

The adapter must:

1. resolve project-relative references through XcircuitePackage;
2. verify input digests;
3. evaluate ToolQualification requirements;
4. invoke the injected engine protocol;
5. persist every returned artifact;
6. map diagnostics and status to FlowStageResult;
7. attach design, PDK and tool provenance;
8. leave approval and resume handling to DesignFlowKernel.
